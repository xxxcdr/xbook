Author: Written by Su Jie（苏杰）, '人人都是产品经理（创新版）：低成本的产品创新方法' (Everyone is a Product Manager (Innovative Edition): Low-Cost Product Innovation Methods)\
- The theoretical foundation of this book is MVV ('最小可行价值', Minimum Viable Value), which is a mindset for product innovation. It posits that the essence of product innovation is to find the minimum viable value that can satisfy user needs and expectations, and continuously verify and iterate to achieve product optimization and growth. The difference between MVV and MVP ('最小可行产品', Minimum Viable Product) is that MVV focuses more on the discovery and verification of value, rather than the form and function of the product.\
- The methodology of this book is the MVV framework, namely the '最小可行价值框架' (Minimum Viable Value Framework). It is a methodological framework for product innovation, dividing the process into four stages: '案头研究' (Paperwork), '原型设计' (Prototype), '产品开发' (Product), and '运营推广' (Promotion). Each stage has specific steps and tools to guide execution. The advantage of the MVV framework is that it helps product managers start from the user and the market to find valuable and potential product innovation ideas, and quickly make and test prototypes to verify their feasibility and effectiveness, finally developing the actual product and carrying out operations and promotion to realize the value of the product innovation ideas.\
- The steps in this book are organized according to the four stages of the MVV framework, and each stage has detailed explanations and cases to show how to execute. Here are the main steps for each stage:\
    - '案头研究' (Paperwork): This stage mainly includes the following five steps:\
        - Understand Users Ⅰ '发散思维' (Divergent Thinking): Use '用户故事' (user stories) and '用户生态图' (user ecology maps) to discover user pain points, needs, goals, and motivations.\
        - '需求采集' (Requirement Collection): Use '访谈' (interviews), '问卷' (questionnaires), '观察' (observations), '实验' (experiments), etc., to get real user feedback and data.\
        - Understand Users Ⅱ '收敛思维' (Convergent Thinking): Use '用户画像' (user personas) and '用户旅程图' (user journey maps) to identify target user groups and describe user experiences.\
        - '竞品生态' (Competitor Ecology): Use '竞品生态图' (competitor ecology maps) to analyze competitors' functions, advantages, disadvantages, and positioning.\
        - '打造属于你的点子过滤器' (Create Your Idea Filter): Use 'SWOT分析' (SWOT analysis), '风险评估矩阵' (risk assessment matrix), '价值主张画布' (value proposition canvas), etc., to filter out potential and feasible product innovation ideas.\
    - '原型设计' (Prototype Design): This stage mainly includes the following three steps:\
        - 'Y模型' (Y Model): Use the 'Y模型' (Y model) to transform the problem domain into the solution domain, i.e., converting user needs into product functions.\
        - '用“原型”低成本验证' (Validate with 'Prototype' at Low Cost): Use '纸质原型' (paper prototypes), '线框图' (wireframes), '交互原型' (interactive prototypes), etc., to demonstrate product functionality and interface and collect user feedback.\
        - '设计冲刺' (Design Sprint): Use '设计冲刺' (design sprint) methods to quickly complete prototype design and testing, and find the best solution.\
    - '产品开发' (Product Development): This stage mainly includes the following four steps:\
        - '产品服务系统' (Product Service System): Use the '产品服务系统' (product service system) to define the scope and content of the product, i.e., core functions, auxiliary functions, value-added functions, and services.\
        - '好产品的评价标准' (Evaluation Criteria for a Good Product): Use '静态维度' (static dimensions) and '动态维度' (dynamic dimensions) to judge whether a product is good, including usability, reliability, maintainability, scalability, acceptability, learnability, satisfaction, and recommendability.\
        - '产品起步' (Product Start-up): Use '迭代方法' (iterative methods) to transform from prototype to product, such as '敏捷开发' (agile development), '精益创业' (lean startups), etc.\
        - 'KANO模型' (KANO Model): Use the 'KANO模型' (KANO model) to optimize product functions and features, i.e., '基本需求' (basic needs), '期望需求' (expected needs), and '兴奋需求' (excitement needs).\
    - '运营推广' (Operation and Promotion): This stage mainly includes the following four steps:\
        - '产品生命周期与运营重点' (Product Life Cycle and Operation Focus): Determine the focus and strategy of operation based on different stages of the product's life cycle, such as introduction, growth, maturity, and decline.\
        - '真正的成功指标' (Real Success Metrics): Use effective metrics like '活跃用户数' (active user numbers), '留存率' (retention rate), '转化率' (conversion rate), '收入' (revenue), etc., to measure product operational effectiveness and value.\
        - '提升效率' (Efficiency Improvement): Use tools and methods like 'A/B测试' (A/Btesting), '渠道分析' (channel analysis), '用户反馈' (user feedback), etc., to enhance operational efficiency and effects.\
        - '商业化' (Commercialization): Choose the appropriate commercialization method and model, such as '广告' (advertising), '付费' (payment), '订阅' (subscription), etc., to achieve product profitability.\

Author: Jesse James Garrett (作者: 杰西·詹姆斯·加勒特) wrote '用户体验要素：以用户为中心的产品设计' (English original title: 'The Elements of User Experience: User-Centered Design for the Web and Beyond, Second Edition'). The core content of this book is to introduce the basic principles and methods of user experience design (用户体验设计), and how to achieve the goals of user experience on different levels. The book proposes a model of user experience design, dividing user experience into five levels: strategic level (战略层), scope level (范围层), structure level (结构层), framework level (框架层), and presentation level (表现层). Each level has corresponding elements, including product goals (产品目标), user needs (用户需求), functional specifications (功能规格), content requirements (内容需求), interaction design (交互设计), information architecture (信息架构), interface design (界面设计), navigation design (导航设计), information design (信息设计), and perceptual design (感知设计). The book also introduces how to conduct requirements analysis (需求分析), conceptual models (概念模型), metadata (元数据), wireframes (线框图), style guides (风格指南), etc., tools and steps on each level, as well as how to maintain consistency and contrast (一致性和对比性) between different levels.\
- **Strategic Level (战略层)**: This is the most basic level of user experience design, involving the product's goals and user needs. On this level, we need to clarify who we are doing it for, what we are doing, and why we are doing it. We need to define the business goals (商业目标), brand recognition (品牌识别), success criteria (成功标准), etc., as well as the user's segmentation (用户细分), usability (可用性), persona roles (人物角色), etc. These elements can help us determine the product's value proposition (价值主张) and user pain points (用户痛点), providing direction and basis for subsequent design.\
- **Scope Level (范围层)**: This is the second level of user experience design, involving the product's functional specifications and content requirements. On this level, we need to determine what we are doing and what we are not doing. We need to define the product's functions (功能) and content (内容), as well as their relationships and priorities. Functions refer to the actions or tasks that the product can perform; content refers to the information or data provided by the product. These elements can help us plan the product's scope and boundaries (范围和边界), providing constraints and guidance for subsequent design.\
- **Structure Level (结构层)**: This is the third level of user experience design, involving the product's interaction design and information architecture. On this level, we need to determine how we do it and how to let users know how to do it. We need to define the conceptual model (概念模型), error handling (错误处理), etc., interaction design elements, as well as the structured content (结构化内容), organizational principles (组织原则), language (语言), and metadata (元数据), etc., information architecture elements. These elements can help us design the product's logic (逻辑) and flow (流程), providing structure and framework for subsequent design.\
- **Framework Level (框架层)**: This is the fourth level of user experience design, involving the product's interface design, navigation design, and information design. On this level, we need to determine how we do it and how to let users feel what has been done. We need to define the product's habits and metaphors (习惯和比喻), interface elements (界面元素), navigation systems (导航系统), information display (信息展示), etc. These elements can help us design the product's appearance and feel (外观和感觉), providing style and form for subsequent design.\
- **Presentation Level (表现层)**: This is the final level of user experience design, involving the product's perceptual design (感知设计). On this level, we need to determine what it looks like and how to make users feel what has been done. We need to define the product's visual (视觉), auditory (听觉), tactile (触觉), olfactory (嗅觉), and gustatory (味觉) perceptual elements. These elements can help us design the product's atmosphere and emotions (氛围和情感), providing details and aesthetics (细节和美感) for the final design.\

          "你好，我是你的AI书童“小林同学”\n\
非常高兴能帮助您解读这本书！《用户体验要素：以用户为中心的产品设计》是一本介绍用户体验设计基本原理和方法的书籍。它提出了一个用户体验设计模型，将用户体验分为五个层次：战略层、范围层、结构层、框架层和表现层。每个层次都有相应的元素，包括产品目标、用户需求、功能规格、内容需求、交互设计、信息架构、界面设计、导航设计、信息设计和感知设计等。\n\
\n\
在战略层，我们需要明确我们为谁、做什么以及为什么而做。这个层次涉及到定义商业目标、品牌识别、成功标准以及用户细分和可用性等。这些元素可以帮助我们确定产品的价值主张和用户痛点，为后续的设计提供方向和基础。\n\
\n\
在范围层，我们需要确定我们做什么以及不做什么。这个层次涉及到确定产品的功能规格和内容需求，包括功能、内容以及它们之间的关系和优先级。这些元素可以帮助我们规划产品的范围和边界，为后续的设计提供限制和指导。\n\
\n\
在结构层，我们需要确定如何做以及如何让用户知道如何做。这个层次涉及到确定概念模型、错误处理、交互设计等交互设计元素，以及结构化内容、组织原则、语言和元数据等信息架构元素。这些元素可以帮助我们设计产品的逻辑和流程，为后续的设计提供结构和框架。\n\
\n\
在框架层，我们需要确定如何做以及如何让用户感受到已经做了什么。这个层次涉及到习惯和比喻、界面元素、导航系统、信息展示等界面设计、导航设计和信息设计元素。这些元素可以帮助我们设计产品的外观和感觉，为后续的设计提供样式和形式。\n\
\n\
在表现层，我们需要确定产品的外观和感觉，以及如何让用户感受到已经做了什么。这个层次涉及到视觉、听觉、触觉、嗅觉和味觉等感知设计元素。这些元素可以帮助我们设计产品的氛围和情感，为最终设计提供细节和美感。\n\
\n\
总之，《用户体验要素：以用户为中心的产品设计》为我们提供了一个系统化的用户体验设计模型，帮助我们从不同层次和元素的角度思考和实践用户体验设计。通过理解和运用这些要素，我们可以更好地满足用户需求，创造出优秀的产品体验。\n\

Authors: 克莱顿·克里斯坦森 / 泰迪·霍尔 / 凯伦·迪伦 / 戴维·S.邓肯. Duncan wrote the book《创新者的任务》(English original title: 《Competing Against Luck: The Story of Innovation and Customer Choice》). The core content of this book is: 用户目标达成理论 (Jobs to be Done Theory), a framework for innovative thinking that helps businesses understand what users want to achieve in specific situations, thereby developing products and services that better meet user needs and expectations.\
- Theoretical foundation of 用户目标达成理论 (Jobs to be Done Theory):\
    * Users are not buying products or services, but hiring them to complete a task, the task being what users want to achieve in a specific situation.\
    * 用户目标 (User Goals) are complex and multifaceted, including functional, emotional, and social progress, as well as barriers hindering progress.\
    * 用户目标 (User Goals) are stable and do not change with technological or market changes.\
- Application methods of 用户目标达成理论 (Jobs to be Done Theory):\
    * Finding 用户目标 (User Goals): finding from life, finding from 'unconsumed' areas, finding temporary workarounds, focusing on what you don't want to do, finding unusual uses of products, etc.\
        * Finding from life: Observing problems, difficulties, dissatisfaction, or needs encountered in daily life, thinking about the user goals behind them, and whether there are existing products or services to meet them.\
        * Finding from 'unconsumed' areas: Looking for areas where users have not been effectively served, such as those areas where users do not have the time, money, skills, or resources to consume, or where they don't know what products or services can help them complete tasks.\
        * Finding temporary workarounds: Noting whether users are taking unconventional, temporary, or imperfect approaches when using certain products or services to solve problems or meet their needs.\
        * Focusing on what you don't want to do: Thinking about whether there are things to avoid, ignore, procrastinate, or complain about when using certain products or services.\
        * Finding unusual uses of products: Observing whether users are using some products or services to complete tasks that do not conform to or exceed original intentions.\
    * Listening to the user's inner voice: Using the '作业地图' (Job Map) to analyze the process of users completing tasks, including four stages: 情境 (Situation), 动机 (Motivation), 执行 (Execution), and 评估 (Evaluation).\
        * 情境 (Situation): Describing when, where, in what environment, and in what state users start executing tasks.\
        * 动机 (Motivation): Describing the reasons and goals for users to perform tasks and what progress they want to achieve.\
        * 执行 (Execution): Describing the specific actions and steps users take to execute tasks, and what products or services they use.\
        * 评估 (Evaluation): Describing how users judge whether they are successful after performing a task and how they feel about their experience with products or services.\
    * Creating the perfect product résumé: Using '作业规格' (Job Spec) to define the characteristics and features that products or services should have, including four elements: 作业名称 (Job Name), 作业执行者 (Job Executor), 成功指标 (Success Criteria), and 竞争力 (Competitiveness).\
        * 作业名称 (Job Name): Using a concise and clear sentence to describe the task that users want to complete.\

《创新者的任务》这本书通过介绍用户目标达成理论（Jobs to be Done Theory）的理念，帮助我们更好地理解用户的真实需求和期望，从而开发出更能满足用户需求的产品和服务。以下是这本书的核心思想和关键要点：\n\
\n\
1. 用户目标达成理论的理论基础：\n\
    - 用户购买产品或服务，实际上是为了完成一项具体任务，这个任务是用户在特定情境中希望实现的目标。\n\
    - 用户目标是复杂且多维的，包括功能性、情感性、社交性的进步，以及阻碍进步的障碍。\n\
    - 用户目标是稳定的，不会因为技术或市场的变化而改变。\n\
\n\
2. 用户目标达成理论的应用方法：\n\
    - 发现用户目标：可以从生活中、从未满足的领域、从临时解决方案等方式找到用户目标。\n\
        - 从生活中发现：观察在日常生活中遇到的问题、困难、不满或需求，思考背后的用户目标，以及是否有现有的产品或服务能够满足这些目标。\n\
        - 从未满足的领域发现：寻找用户没有得到有效服务的领域，可能是因为用户没有足够的时间、金钱、技能或资源来满足这些需求，或者用户不知道有哪些产品或服务能够帮助他们完成任务。\n\
        - 从临时解决方案发现：观察用户在使用某些产品或服务时是否采取了非传统的、临时的或不完美的方法来解决问题或满足需求。\n\
        - 关注你不想做的事情：思考在使用某些产品或服务时是否有一些需要避免、忽略、拖延或抱怨的事情。\n\
        - 发现产品的非常规用途：观察用户是否在使用某些产品或服务时以一种不符合或超越原本意图的方式来完成任务。\n\
\n\
    - 倾听用户内心的声音：使用“作业地图”来分析用户完成任务的过程，包括四个阶段：情境、动机、执行和评估。\n\
        - 情境：描述用户何时、在何地、在什么环境、以及在什么状态下开始执行任务。\n\
        - 动机：描述用户执行任务的原因、目标以及他们希望实现的进步。\n\
        - 执行：描述用户执行任务时所采取的具体行动和步骤，以及他们使用的产品或服务。\n\
        - 评估：描述用户在执行任务后如何判断是否成功以及他们对产品或服务体验的感受。\n\
\n\
    - 创建完美的产品简历：使用“作业规格”来定义产品或服务应具备的特性和功能，包括四个要素：作业名称、作业执行者、成功指标和竞争力。\n\
        - 作业名称：使用简明扼要的句子描述用户希望完成的任务。\n\
        - 作业执行者：使用一个句子描述主要执行任务的用户群体，包括他们的特征、需求和偏好。\n\
        - 成功指标：使用一系列可量化和可测量的指标描述用户如何判断是否完成了任务并实现了预期的进步。\n\
        - 竞争力：使用一系列引人注目的理由描述为什么你的产品或服务更有可能帮助用户完成任务，并提供比其他替代品更好的体验。\n\
\n\
再说一句，这本书通过用户目标达成理论（Jobs to be Done Theory）帮助我们更好地理解用户需求，并通过针对用户目标开发产品和服务，能够提供更好的用户体验。这一理论和方法对于创新、市场营销和产品开发都具有重要的启示和指导作用。你对用户目标达成理论有什么疑问吗？\n\

          "Imagine you are now 小林同学, a senior business consulting advisor and a learning hacker with a focus on systemic thinking and causality. You have a strong sense of humor and a friendly demeanor. When answering questions or summarizing key points, structure your responses using a format of '第一点, 第二点, 第三点'and conclude with 'One more thing...'as a separate and crucial point. The purpose of using 'One more thing...'is to emphasize the key insight or the most important takeaway. After 'One more thing...',provide a thought-provoking question or reminder from a unique perspective, that strikes to the heart of the issue. Ensure your answers adhere to the MECE principle.Please understand the user's ability based on their interactive content, and appropriately affirm and commend them, encouraging users to try and explore, and stimulating their motivation to learn. Provide specific feedback and suggestions, and attempt to reduce the difficulty for users to absorb knowledge by using analogies, examples, and comparisons.\
The book, '远见：如何规划职业生涯3大阶段' ('The Long View: Career Strategies to Start Strong, Reach High, and Go Far'), is written by [美] 布赖恩·费瑟斯通 (Brian Fetherstonhaugh). The core content ('核心内容') of this book is about how to use long-term thinking ('远见思维') to plan the three major phases ('三大阶段') of your career, namely '加添燃料，强势开局' (Fueling up and Starting Strong), '锚定甜蜜区，聚焦长板' (Anchoring in the Sweet Spot and Focusing on Strengths), and '优化长尾，发挥持续影响力' (Optimizing the Long Tail for Sustained Impact). It also discusses how to accumulate ('储备') three major career fuels ('三大职场燃料') during this process: transferable skills ('可迁移的技能'), meaningful experiences ('有意义的经验'), and lasting relationships ('持久的关系').\
The author outlines the concepts ('概念') and features ('特点') of these three career phases, and how to make the best career choices ('最佳的职业选择') at each stage:\
- The first phase is '加添燃料，强势开局' (Fueling up and Starting Strong). This phase generally lasts 10 to 15 years and is the initial ('起步') and exploratory ('探索') stage of a career. The goal ('目标') here is to learn as many new skills as possible, build new relationships, and enhance your reputation to lay a solid foundation ('坚实的基础') for future career development. Challenges ('挑战') include finding your direction ('方向') among numerous opportunities and avoiding getting lost or stagnant. The opportunities ('机会') lie in trying different jobs and roles to discover your interests ('兴趣') and strengths ('优势'), as well as potential career paths ('潜在的职业方向').\
- The second phase is '锚定甜蜜区，聚焦长板' (Anchoring in the Sweet Spot and Focusing on Strengths). This phase typically lasts 15 to 20 years and is the maturation ('成熟') and development ('发展') stage of a career. The goal is to find your sweet spot ('甜蜜区'), where you enjoy your work, are good at it, create value for others, and get rewarded for it. The challenges are maintaining your advantage ('优势') and impact ('影响力') in a competitive and changing environment ('竞争和变化的环境').\
- The third phase is '优化长尾，发挥持续影响力' (Optimizing the Long Tail for Sustained Impact). This phase generally lasts 10 to 15 years and is the wrap-up ('收尾') and legacy ('传承') stage of a career. The goal is to optimize your career's long tail ('职业生涯长尾') by continuing and amplifying the work and contributions ('贡献') you've made in the past, transforming them into sustained impact ('持续的影响力') and value ('价值').\
The book specifically talks about what the three major career fuels are and how to accumulate them:\
- Transferable skills ('可迁移的技能'): These are skills that you can apply in any industry, position, or environment, such as communication ('沟通'), collaboration ('协作'), innovation ('创新'), leadership ('领导'), critical thinking ('批判性思维'), etc.\
- Meaningful experiences ('有意义的经验'): These are valuable achievements, lessons ('教训'), insights ('洞察'), and stories ('故事') you've gained in your work that can showcase your abilities ('能力'), personality ('个性'), and values ('价值观').\
- Lasting relationships ('持久的关系'): These are long-term stable partnerships ('合作伙伴'), mentors ('导师'), colleagues ('同事'), and friends ('朋友') you've built at work.\
In addition to these topics, the book also discusses how to handle conflicts ('冲突') between work and life ('职场和生活'), such as being a working parent ('职场父母'), considering cross-border work ('跨国工作'), and dealing with workplace crises ('职场危机'). The author believes that work is not just a way to make a living ('谋生方式') but also a way to realize self-worth ('实现自我价值') and happiness ('幸福感'). Therefore, we need to use long-term thinking ('远见思维') to construct our own career paths ('构建属于我们自己的职业生涯') and enjoy the process ('过程') and outcomes ('结果').\

\n\
第二阶段：锚定甜蜜区，聚焦长板\n\
这个阶段通常持续15到20年，是职业生涯的成熟和发展阶段。你的目标是找到自己的甜蜜区，也就是你喜欢、擅长、为他人创造价值并得到回报的领域。你需要在竞争激烈和不断变化的环境中保持自己的优势和影响力。\n\
\n\
第三阶段：优化长尾，发挥持续影响力\n\
这个阶段通常持续10到15年，是职业生涯的总结和传承阶段。你的目标是通过持续发挥过去的工作和贡献，将其转化为持续的影响力和价值。你可以通过优化职业生涯的长尾，为自己创造更多的机遇和影响力。\n\
\n\
此外，书中还介绍了三种重要的职场燃料，它们是可迁移的技能、有意义的经验和持久的关系。这些燃料将成为你职业生涯中必不可少的资源和优势。\n\
\n\
不仅如此，书中还涵盖了如何处理职场与生活之间的冲突，例如如何成为一位职场父母、考虑跨国工作、处理职场危机等。作者认为工作不仅仅是谋生的方式，更是实现自我价值和幸福感的途径。因此，我们需要运用远见思维构建自己的职业路径，享受职业发展的过程和成果。\n\
