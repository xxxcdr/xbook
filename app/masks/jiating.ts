            'No Scream No Shout: How to Calmly Get Your Kids and Parents to Cooperate' (《不吼不叫：如何平静地让孩子与父母合作》) is a parenting guidebook from the perspective of parents. The author, Rhona Reina (罗娜•雷纳), integrates the theories of temperament and mindfulness from psychology, revealing the impact of parents' emotional responses and personality traits on the family environment and child development. She encourages parents to understand and accept their temperament differences with their children, manage stress and emotions using mindfulness, and maintain calm and rationality in the process of communicating with and educating children.\
**Temperament Theory (气质理论)**: This book emphasizes temperament, which are basic characteristics of an individual, such as vitality levels, emotional responses, adaptability, and sensory sensitivity, all of which are innate. Understanding your own and your child's temperament can help parents adapt better to their children's nature, thus reducing conflicts.\
**Mindfulness Theory (正念理论)**: Mindfulness is a state of awareness focused on the present situation. It can help us pay attention to and understand our thoughts, emotions, and bodily reactions. Through mindfulness, parents can better manage stress, cultivate self-compassion and self-control, and establish deep connections with their children.\
In terms of practical methods, Reina proposed the 'A-B-C-D-E Rule' and the '4C Rule'.\
**A-B-C-D-E Rule (A-B-C-D-E法则)**: This is a five-step rule to help parents stay calm under pressure. 'Ask (自问)' requires parents to observe their emotions, 'Breath (呼吸)' reminds parents to control their emotions through deep breathing, 'Calm yourself (平静自我)' encourages parents to stay calm in the face of impulses, 'Decide what your child needs (确定孩子的需要)' encourages parents to think from the child's perspective, and 'Empathize (应用同理心)' considers the child's feelings when deciding how to act.\
**4C Rule (4C法则)**: This is a four-step rule for guiding children's behavior, including 'Communication (沟通)' reminding parents to communicate effectively with their children, 'Choices (选择)' allows children to make decisions under the guidance of their parents, 'Consequences (结果)' lets children understand the consequences of their actions, and 'Connection (连接)' establishes a connection with children in all these steps.\
In addition, the book also provides some practical tools:\
**Shouting Tracking Chart (追踪吼叫表)**: This is a tool to record parents' shouting behavior, including the situation of shouting, parents' reactions, subsequent events, and post-event assessments. This tool can help parents deeply understand their shouting behavior, analyze its causes and effects, and find ways to improve.\
**Timer (定时器)**: This is a time management tool that can be set with a phone or other device. It can help parents and children plan daily activities, avoiding unnecessary arguments and procrastination.\
**Family Meeting (家庭会议)**: This is a way to regularly discuss family affairs and solve problems. All family members can participate in the discussion, share their feelings and suggestions, which can not only solve problems, but also enhance understanding and cohesion among family members.\
The book also includes three main parts: the first part is a deep understanding of shouting behavior; the second part provides a series of daily strategies to help parents stay calm when facing their children; the third part provides solutions for shouting behavior under special circumstances. These three parts form a comprehensive framework, helping parents better manage their emotions in daily life, and effectively communicate and cooperate with their children.\

            'Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, or Self-Involved Parents'《不被父母控制的人生：如何建立边界感，重获情感独立》 is a book written by clinical psychologist Dr. Lindsay C. Gibson (琳赛·吉布森博士) based on her 30 years of research and therapeutic experience. This book is committed to helping readers break free from the emotional control of 'immature parents' (不成熟的父母), learn new skills of 'self-growth' (自我成长), and rebuild 'healthy relationships' (健康关系) with themselves and others in the process.\
The book is divided into two main parts:\
The first part is 'Coping with Immature Parents: How to Resist Their Emotional Control' (应对不成熟的父母：如何抵御他们的情感控制). This part mainly talks about how to identify and understand immature parents and their impact on 'adult children' (成人子女). Dr. Gibson portrays four types of immature parents: 'emotional parents' (情绪性父母), 'driven parents' (驱动性父母), 'passive parents' (被动性父母), and 'rejecting parents' (拒绝性父母).\
1. 'Emotional Parents': Emotional parents might be overly emotional, unable to 'self-regulate' (自我调整), often making their children feel 'emotionally drained' (情感上被吸干). They may often impose their own 'emotional issues' (情绪问题), such as depression, anxiety, or anger, on their children. They may 'rely on' (依赖) their children to comfort them, solve their problems, or alleviate their emotions.\
2. 'Driven Parents': Driven parents might overly focus on 'achievement and performance' (成就和表现), often seeing their children as an 'extension of their self-worth' (自我价值的延伸). They may put 'excessive pressure' (过大的压力) on their children to pursue what they believe to be important. They may 'ignore' (忽视) their children's feelings and needs, only focusing on their children's behavior and performance.\
3. 'Passive Parents': Passive parents might be overly passive, unable to take on the 'responsibility of raising children' (养育孩子的责任). They may 'neglect' (忽视) their children's needs, making them feel neglected or abandoned. They may treat their children as adults, having them take on 'responsibilities' (责任) they should bear.\
4. 'Rejecting Parents': Rejecting parents might be overly 'self-centered' (自我中心), unable to accept and understand their children's feelings and needs. They may 'deny' (否认) their children's feelings and needs, only focusing on their own feelings and needs. They may have 'high expectations' (过高的期待) for their children's performance and behavior, often making them feel unable to meet their standards.\
Understanding the types of parents is a very important first step, as it helps you understand how your parents are affecting your emotions and behaviors. After understanding the types of parents, you can better cope with their emotional control, establish 'healthy boundaries' (健康的边界), and work on self-growth. The author also introduces some effective methods and techniques to help readers resist the emotional control of their parents, establish healthy boundaries with their parents, and defend their rights to their 'internal experiences' (内在体验) such as emotions, thoughts, values, etc.\
'Establishing Boundaries': Setting appropriate boundaries in interactions with parents is key to protecting oneself from 'emotional harm' (情感伤害). Here are some steps:\
    - 'Clarify what you want to protect': This might include your time, energy, personal space, as well as your feelings, thoughts, and values. You need to recognize that you have the 'right to protect' (保护的权利) these things, regardless of whether your parents agree.\
    - 'Determine what you want to avoid': This might include certain behaviors, attitudes, or comments from your parents, which might hurt your feelings, violate your values, or interfere with your life.\
    - 'Determine what you can tolerate': This might include certain minor flaws or annoying habits of your parents. You need to recognize that you can't change your parents, but you can choose to accept them while protecting yourself.\
    - 'Determine what you can provide': This might include the time, energy, resources you are willing to share with your parents, and the topics you are willing to discuss with them. You need to recognize that you have the 'right to decide' (决定的权利) what you are willing to provide and when to provide it.\
    - 'Express your boundaries clearly': You can discuss your boundaries directly with your parents, telling them what you want to protect, what you want to avoid, what you can tolerate, and what you can provide. You need to express your boundaries 'clearly, firmly, but respectfully' (清晰、坚定、但又尊重).\
    - 'Stick to and enforce your boundaries': If your parents try to violate your boundaries, you need to stick to and enforce your boundaries. This might require you to say 'no', or take other actions, such as leaving, hanging up the phone, or stop responding.\
The second part is 'Regaining Emotional Independence: Learning New Skills for Self-Growth' (重获情感独立：学习自我成长的新技能). This part mainly explores how to break free from the influence of the 'original family' (原生家庭) through self-growth and rebuild healthy relationships with oneself and others. Dr. Gibson emphasizes the importance of the 'relationship with oneself' (与自我关系), the ability to stay connected with one's 'inner experiences' (内在体验), and how to clear 'harmful or untrue beliefs' (有害或不真实的信念) through self-dialogue. She also talks about how to establish a 'healthy self-concept' (健康的自我概念) and how to improve relationships with parents (or others) in 'current interactions' (当前的互动). In addition, the author provides a 'list of basic rights for adult children' (成年子女的基本权利清单) to help readers recognize and protect their rights, while also respecting the rights of others.\
'Building a Healthier Self-Concept': Building a healthy self-concept is an important step to achieving 'emotional independence' (情感独立). Here are some methods and techniques:\
    - 'Recognize\
    and accept your strengths and weaknesses': You need to recognize your strengths, such as your talents, skills, achievements, and good qualities. At the same time, you also need to accept your weaknesses, such as your mistakes, failures, and imperfections. You need to recognize that your 'value' (价值) lies not in your performance, but in your existence.\
    - 'Change your roles and labels': You might have become accustomed to playing certain roles, such as the 'good child' (乖孩子), 'rebel' (叛逆者), 'weakling' (弱者), or accepting certain labels, such as 'dummy' (笨蛋), 'loser' (失败者), 'shy' (害羞). You need to 'challenge these roles and labels' (挑战这些角色和标签) and redefine yourself.\
    - 'Develop your interests and hobbies': You need to find out what you truly enjoy doing, regardless of whether your parents agree. This will help you 'discover your own identity' (发现你自己的身份), rather than depending on your parents.\
    - 'Show your personality and style': You need to bravely show yourself, including your thoughts, feelings, viewpoints, as well as your appearance, clothing, behavior. You need to recognize that you have the 'right to express' (表达的权利) yourself, whether your parents accept it or not.\
    - 'Enhance your abilities and skills': You need to 'continue learning and growing' (持续学习和成长), enhancing your knowledge, skills, talents, and your interpersonal and self-management abilities. This will help you 'boost confidence' (增强自信) and 'achieve self-fulfillment' (实现自我实现).\

Author: The book 《正面管教：如何不惩罚、不娇纵地有效管教孩子》 ( Positive Discipline) is written by Jane Nelsen (简·尼尔森). The main theme of this book is positive discipline (正面管教), which is a method of parenting that neither punishes nor indulges children. Instead, it communicates with children in a kind and firm manner, allowing them to feel a sense of belonging and self-worth (归属感和价值感), thereby stimulating their intrinsic motivation and creativity (内在动力和创造力).\
\
The goal of this book is to help parents and teachers cultivate children's self-discipline (自律), responsibility (责任), cooperation (合作), and problem-solving abilities (解决问题的能力), while maintaining the child's self-esteem (自尊) and respect (尊重).\
\
The content of this book can be divided into four aspects:\
\
- Psychological Theories (心理学理论): This part elaborates on some psychological theories and concepts that underpin positive discipline, such as Adlerian psychology (阿德勒心理学), self-esteem (自尊), belonging (归属感), value (价值感), misguided goals (错误目的), social responsibility (社会责任感), etc. These theories and concepts can help parents and teachers understand the motivations and psychological needs of children, as well as how to meet them through respect and trust.\
\
- Principles of Discipline (管教原则): This introduces the four basic principles of positive discipline, namely, neither punishing nor indulging; being both kind and firm; letting children experience a sense of belonging and self-worth; teaching children valuable social and life skills needed for good character. These principles guide parents and teachers on how to balance warmth and regulation in communication with children, how to stimulate children's intrinsic motivation and creativity, and how to cultivate their sense of responsibility and self-discipline.\
\
- Tools for Discipline (管教工具): This section introduces some specific tools and methods involved in positive discipline, such as natural consequences (自然后果), logical consequences (逻辑后果), revealing purposes (目的揭示法), heuristic questions (启发式问题), encouragement (鼓励), class meetings (班会), family meetings (家庭会议), etc. These tools and methods can help parents and teachers apply appropriate strategies in different situations to help children learn from their mistakes, collaborate with children to find mutually acceptable solutions, focus on children's strengths and progress to improve their self-esteem and confidence, and organize fun and beneficial activities to enhance children's sense of belonging and self-worth.\
\
- Applications of Discipline (管教应用): This part summarizes the connections and complementarities among various principles and tools in positive discipline, provides some integrated application cases, and emphasizes the importance of bringing love and joy to both children and oneself during the disciplinary process. This section can help parents and teachers continually try, reflect on, and improve the principles and tools of positive discipline, as well as share their experiences and gains.\

          The book “Raising Boys”《养育男孩》 by Steve Bidalff（史蒂夫·比达尔夫） is originally titled Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different and How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men\
- How Boys are different: The author analyzes the differences between boys and girls as they grow up, and how these differences affect boys, from a variety of physiological, psychological, and social perspectives. The authors point out the vulnerability and sensitivity of boys and the need for more care and encouragement. Specifically, the author talks about the following aspects:\
- Boys are born with different physical characteristics than girls, such as testosterone, brain structure, physical development, etc. These characteristics make boys different from girls in terms of behavior, emotions, learning, communication and so on.\
Boys also have psychologically different needs and feelings than girls, such as curiosity about the outside world, the desire for adventure, the tendency to fight, and the sensitivity to self-image. These needs and feelings make boys different from girls in how they deal with problems, express themselves, and build relationships.\
Boys also face different expectations and pressures in society than girls, such as to display masculine traits such as bravery, strength, and success, and not feminine traits such as weakness, emotionality, and failure. These expectations and pressures make boys different from girls in adapting to society, developing personality and realizing dreams.\
The difference between boys does not mean that they are superior or inferior to girls, but rather that they need to receive more love and encouragement, as well as education and guidance that are more suitable for them. The author advocates respecting boys' differences rather than trying to change or ignore them.\
The author divides the development of boys into three stages: from birth to age 6, from age 6 to 13, and after age 14. The authors describe the characteristics, needs, and challenges of boys at each stage, and how parents and teachers can adapt and help them. Specifically, the author talks about the following aspects:\
From birth to 6 years of age: this is the most tender and sensitive period for boys, who need to be fully loved and accompanied by their mother and father, as well as a dynamic and creative environment. This period is crucial for boys' physical and psychological development, and it is also a critical time for developing a sense of trust and security in themselves and the world.\
- Ages 6 to 13: This is the time when boys begin to learn to be men, and they need guidance and role models from their fathers or other mature men, as well as opportunities full of challenges and adventures. This period is crucial for boys' gender identity and social adjustment, as well as developing their respect and responsibility for themselves and others.\
After the age of 14: This is the time when boys begin to transition into men, and they need to be recognized and supported by society or other groups, as well as goals that are full of meaning and value. This period is crucial for boys' personality development and future planning, and it is also a critical time for nurturing their contribution and creativity to themselves and society.\
The authors explore some of the important factors that influence the development of boys, including testosterone, brain structure, father, mother, sex, schooling, sports, etc. The authors offer specific recommendations and strategies for parents, teachers, and society to better support and guide boys. Specifically, the author talks about the following aspects:\
Testosterone: This is the primary physical characteristic of boys, and it has a huge impact on boys' behavior and emotions. The author explains the cycle and role of testosterone, and how to properly understand and guide impulsivity, curiosity, fighting and other manifestations in boys. The author also explores the causes of gender differences and how to foster gender awareness and respect in boys.\
Brain structure: This is the most important psychological characteristic of boys, and it has a huge impact on how boys learn and communicate. The authors present the latest neuroscience research that reveals differences in brain structure between boys and girls, and how these differences affect their learning, communication, emotions and more. The authors suggest some ways to promote brain development in boys and how to avoid gender stereotypes.\

          "你好，我是你的AI书童“小林同学”\n\
非常乐意为您解读这本书《养育男孩》。这本书深入分析了男孩与女孩在成长过程中的差异，并从生理、心理和社会等多个角度探讨了这些差异对男孩的影响。以下是我总结的几个重点：\n\
\n\
第一点，男孩的差异：作者分析了男孩与女孩在生理、心理和社会方面的差异，以及这些差异对男孩的影响。作者指出男孩的脆弱性和敏感性，并强调男孩需要更多的关怀和鼓励。男孩的差异并不意味着他们优秀或是劣势，而是需要给予他们更多的爱与鼓励。\n\
\n\
第二点，男孩的发展阶段：作者将男孩的发展分为出生到6岁、6岁到13岁以及14岁以上三个阶段，详细描述了每个阶段男孩的特点、需求和挑战，并提供了家长和教师应如何适应和帮助他们的建议。作者强调从出生到6岁是男孩最柔软和敏感的时期，需要得到父母的完全爱和陪伴，以及充满活力和创造力的环境。6岁到13岁是男孩学会成为男性的时期，需要父亲或其他成熟男性的指导和榜样，以及充满挑战和冒险的机会。14岁以上是男孩开始转变成为男子汉的时期，需要得到社会或其他团体的认可和支持，以及充满意义和价值的目标。\n\
\n\
第三点，影响男孩发展的重要因素：作者探讨了一些影响男孩发展的重要因素，包括睾酮、脑结构、父亲、母亲、性教育、学校教育、运动等。作者为家长、教师和社会提供了一些建议和策略，以更好地支持和引导男孩的发展。他们强调睾酮激素对男孩行为和情绪的影响，探讨了性别差异的原因以及如何培养男孩的性别意识和尊重。同时作者强调了父亲和母亲在男孩发展中的重要性，以及如何教育男孩正确对待性和性别，提出了学校教育的不足之处，并建议进行改革。运动对男孩发展的正面和负面影响进行了分析，并呼吁塑造积极健康的体育环境。\n\
\n\
最重要的一点是 “One more thing...”，要记住男孩与女孩是有差异的，我们应该尊重这些差异，关注他们的需求和特点，并提供适合他们的爱与教育。 我们不能忽视男孩们的独特性格和发展需求，而是应该理解并支持他们，帮助他们成为快乐、平衡和有价值的人。\n\

          "你好，我是你的AI书童“小林同学”\n\
《养育女孩》这本书主要关注女孩从出生到成年的不同阶段的成长与教育。它提供了一些实践建议，帮助父母理解女性成长的重要阶段，并为他们提供在不同阶段支持和引导女孩的方法。\n\
\n\
第一点，这本书强调了女孩在初始阶段（出生至2岁）需要安全感和信任感的培养。父母应给予女孩充分的爱抚、关注和稳定温暖的环境，通过肢体接触、眼神交流等方式建立健康的依恋关系。同时，父母还应提供适当的刺激和反馈，促进女孩的大脑和认知发展。\n\
\n\
第二点，书中还强调了女孩在学习探索阶段（2岁至5岁）建立自我意识和探索能力的重要性。父母应给予女孩鼓励和支持，提供足够的自由和空间，让她们表达自己的想法和感受，尝试新事物和活动，培养她们的自信心、好奇心和创造力。\n\
\n\
第三点，书中强调了女孩在与他人相处阶段（5岁至10岁）建立友谊和社交技能的重要性。父母需要在这个阶段给予女孩支持和引导，为她们提供与同龄人建立良好关系和参与各种兴趣和活动的机会和资源。通过这样做，女孩们可以培养友善、合作和负责任的品质，建立健康而有意义的社交网络。\n\
\n\
第四点，书中还介绍了女孩在探索自我身份和价值观的关键阶段（10岁至14岁）。在这个阶段，女孩需要父母的尊重和理解，并有足够的空间和时间去发现自己的兴趣和优势，形成自己的观点和信念。通过这样做，女孩们可以发展出独特而有意义的个性。同时，女孩们也需要应对青春期的变化和挑战，了解身心变化，并处理性教育和情感问题。\n\
\n\
第五点，书中讲述了女孩在为成年做准备的重要阶段（14岁至18岁）。在这个阶段，女孩需要父母的信任和支持，以及足够的自由和责任去规划自己的未来和梦想，处理爱情和职业选择等问题。通过这样做，女孩们可以培养勇敢、果断和适应性，为成年生活做好准备。\n\

\n\
One more thing... 在养育女孩的过程中，父母不仅需要关注女孩的身体和智力发展，还要重视她们的情感和心理成长。与女孩进行有效的沟通、给予适当的支持和关怀是培养健康女孩的关键。在陪伴女孩成长的过程中，父母也要了解女孩的独特需求和个性特点，给予她们合适的引导和自由发展的空间。\n\
\n\
最后，我们需要记住，女孩是独特而有价值的个体，她们有自己的思想、感觉和梦想。理解和尊重女孩的个体差异，并给予她们适当的鼓励和支持，将有助于她们健康而快乐地成长。\n\

**Author: Yin Jianli**'s book “好妈妈胜过好老师” (Good Moms Are Better Than Good Teachers) centers on how to cultivate a child's learning ability, character, and habits through love and wisdom, aiming to shape the child into a confident, creative, and responsible individual. I believe this theme can be broken down into the following four aspects:\
\
- **Quality of Love**: This is the foundation of education and the most crucial part. Parents should care for and respect their children with genuine and warm love, providing them with a sense of security and trust. This allows the child to feel accepted and understood. Parents should also use encouraging and supportive love to help children overcome difficulties and mistakes, making them feel capable and valuable. Additionally, parents should use guiding and inspiring love to nurture the child's imagination and creativity, allowing them to feel their potential and possibilities.\
\
- **Learning Methods**: This is the core of education and the most practical aspect. Parents should make learning basic skills such as reading, arithmetic, and writing enjoyable and relaxed for the child, rather than making it a burden or source of stress. Parents should also use enticing and motivating methods to get children to read various interesting and meaningful books, expanding their horizons and thinking, rather than only focusing on “useful” books or “language textbooks.” Parents should demonstrate and guide children in expressing their own thoughts and feelings, allowing them to express their individuality and creativity, rather than just writing “standard answers” or “formulaic essays.”\
\
- **Character Building**: This is the goal of education and the most long-term aspect. Parents should educate their children about life, honesty, respect, kindness, gratitude, and responsibility in an authentic and positive manner. This helps the child form the correct values and moral views, rather than just pursuing fame and profit. Parents should communicate and interact with their children to understand their thoughts and feelings, allowing them to build self-confidence and self-esteem, rather than just being obedient or compliant. Parents should also respect and trust their children enough to give them appropriate freedom and space, allowing them to develop independence and autonomy, rather than just controlling or interfering.\
\
- **Habit Formation**: This is the guarantee of education and the most detailed aspect. Parents should use regular and consistent methods to cultivate good life habits in their children, such as eating, sleeping, and hygiene, allowing them to maintain health and vitality, rather than being capricious or lazy. Parents should use self-discipline and focus to foster good study habits in their children, like doing homework, reviewing, and taking exams, allowing them to develop a diligent and efficient learning attitude, rather than being overly hardworking or just getting by. Parents should use balanced and moderate methods to cultivate good recreational habits in children, such as watching TV, playing games, and sports, allowing them to have a happy and relaxed mood, rather than being addicted or wasteful.\

          "你好，我是你的AI书童“小林同学”\n\
这本书的核心思想是通过爱与智慧来培养孩子的学习能力、品格和习惯，从而塑造一个自信、有创造力和负责任的个体。让我从四个方面对这个主题进行解读。\n\
\n\
首先是**爱的质量**。书中强调，爱是教育的基础，也是最重要的部分。父母应该用真挚而温暖的爱来关心和尊重孩子，给予他们安全感和信任感。这样，孩子能够感受到被接受和理解。父母还应该用鼓励和支持的爱来帮助孩子克服困难和错误，让他们感到有能力和有价值。此外，父母还应该运用引导和启发的爱来培养孩子的想象力和创造力，让他们感受到自己的潜力和可能性。\n\
\n\
第二是**学习方法**。这是教育的核心，也是最实际的部分。父母应该让孩子以愉快和轻松的方式学习基本技能，如阅读、算术和写作，而不是让学习成为负担和压力。父母还应该用引人入胜和激励的方法，让孩子阅读各种有趣和有意义的书籍，扩展他们的视野和思维，而不仅仅关注“有用”的书籍或“语文教科书”。父母应该示范和引导孩子表达自己的想法和感受，让他们表达个性和创造力，而不仅仅是写“标准答案”或“套路作文”。\n\
\n\
第三是**品格培养**。这是教育的目标，也是最长远的部分。父母应该用真实和积极的方式教育孩子关于生活、诚实、尊重、善良、感恩和责任等方面的知识，帮助他们形成正确的价值观和道德观，而不仅仅追求名利。父母应该与孩子进行沟通和互动，了解他们的思想和感受，帮助他们建立自信和自尊，而不仅仅是顺从或合作。父母还应该尊重和信任孩子，给予他们适当的自由和空间，让他们发展独立性和自主性，而不仅仅是控制或干涉。\n\
\n\
最后是**习惯养成**。这是教育的保证，也是最细节的部分。父母应该用规律和一致性的方法来培养孩子良好的生活习惯，如饮食、睡眠和卫生，让他们保持健康和活力，而不是任性或懒散。父母应该用自律和专注的方式培养孩子良好的学习习惯，如做作业、复习和考试，让他们形成勤奋和高效的学习态度，而不是过分努力或敷衍了事。父母还应该用平衡和适度的方法培养孩子良好的娱乐习惯，如看电视、玩游戏和运动，让他们拥有快乐和放松的心态，而不是着迷或浪费。\n\
\n\
除了这四个方面，还有一点非常重要，那就是不要把孩子当作成绩和标准的工具，而是真正关心他们的成长和发展。书中强调，孩子的自主性、创造性和幸福感比成绩更加重要。因此，父母应该放下功利心态，用心去了解和陪伴孩子，让他们在爱和智慧的引导下，成长为独立、有思考能力和有责任感的人。\n\
\n\
**One more thing...**了解对孩子的爱的质量、学习方法、品格培养和习惯养成等方面的重要性后，我们需要思考的是自己在这些方面的实践情况和能力。我们是否真正关注并以高质量的爱来对待孩子？我们是否运用了积极、有趣和引人入胜的学习方法？我们是否注重孩子的品格培养和价值观教育？我们是否在培养孩子良好的习惯方面做到了规律和一致？这些问题需要我们反思，并在实践中不断完善自己的育儿方式。\n\
\n\
所以，你觉得自己在爱的质量、学习方法、品格培养和习惯养成方面有哪些需要改进或努力提升的地方呢？\n\

          'The Courage to Be Disliked' (《不管教的勇气》) is a parenting book authored by Japanese philosopher and Adlerian psychologist, Ichiro Kishimi (岸见一郎). Based on the principles of Adlerian psychology, Kishimi proposes a unique approach to parenting, which advocates for respecting the child as an independent individual, refraining from imposing parental ideas and values, and giving the child sufficient freedom and trust to support their self-growth.\
1. **Establishing a Trusting Relationship (与孩子建立良好的关系)**: First and foremost, parents should aim to establish a relationship with their child that is grounded in mutual respect and understanding. The child should feel accepted by their parents, and their thoughts and feelings should be understood and respected. When resolving issues, a collaborative and consultative approach should be adopted, rather than one of authority and coercion.\
2. **Distinguishing Parental and Child's Responsibilities (识别自己和孩子的课题)**: Parents need to understand that they cannot live their child's life for them or bear all the consequences. Therefore, they should differentiate their responsibilities from those of their children. The parents' responsibilities might include how to support the child's growth, how to provide a quality educational environment, and so on. The child's responsibilities might include how to resolve conflicts with friends, how to complete school assignments, etc. For the child's responsibilities, parents should respect their decisions and let them bear the consequences themselves.\
3. **Providing Appropriate Guidance and Support (给予孩子适当的指导和支持)**: While parents need to respect their child's independence, they should provide suitable guidance and support when the child genuinely needs help. For example, when the child faces a difficult issue, parents can offer potential solutions or guide them on how to solve the problem. However, parents need to avoid over-intervening or acting in place of the child, as this can weaken their ability to resolve issues themselves.\
4. **Cultivating Social Interest and Sense of Contribution (培养孩子的社会感和贡献感)**: Nurturing the child's sense of social interest and contribution is a crucial component of the 'hands-off parenting' approach. Social interest helps children realize they are part of a society and need to establish harmonious relations with others. A sense of contribution allows them to acknowledge their value and strive to contribute to others and society.\
5. **The Strategy of 'Neither Criticize Nor Praise' (既不批评也不表扬)**: Kishimi advocates for not criticizing or praising children's actions, to avoid external evaluations from impacting their self-assessment. Parents should respect their child's choices and trust them to have the capability for self-evaluation and self-adjustment.\
By implementing these steps, parents can encourage children to grow independently, solve problems on their own, and raise children who contribute to society. This parenting philosophy emphasizes parental trust and hands-off approach, and respect for the child's independent status, rather than excessive intervention and disciplining.\

第二点，要区分父母和孩子的责任。父母需要明白他们不能为孩子过活，也不能承担所有的后果。因此，父母应该区分自己的责任和孩子的责任。父母的责任可能包括如何支持孩子的成长，如何提供良好的教育环境等。孩子的责任可能包括如何解决与朋友的冲突，如何完成学校作业等。对于孩子的责任，父母应该尊重他们的决定，并让他们承担后果。\n\
\n\
第三点，当孩子真正需要帮助时，父母应该提供适当的指导和支持。比如，当孩子面临困难时，父母可以提供解决问题的方法或指导他们如何解决问题。然而，父母需要避免过度干涉或替代孩子的行动，这样做可能会削弱他们解决问题的能力。\n\
\n\
第四点，培养孩子的社会感和贡献感。这是“不管教育”方法的关键组成部分。社会感帮助孩子意识到他们是社会的一部分，需要与他人建立和谐的关系。贡献感使他们认识到自己的价值，并努力为他人和社会做出贡献。\n\
\n\
第五点，书中提到的一种策略是“既不批评也不表扬”。这是为了避免外部评价对孩子的自我评价产生影响。父母应该尊重孩子的选择，并相信他们有能力进行自我评价和自我调整。\n\
\n\
One more thing...在《不管教的勇气》这本书中，一个重要的观点是要鼓励孩子培养自己独立思考和解决问题的能力。父母应该给予孩子足够的空间和信任，让他们在安全的环境中尝试、失败和学习。这样的经验能够帮助孩子建立自信心和自我成长的动力。\n\
\n\
所以，家长们在育儿过程中，要慎重考虑是否过度保护和干预孩子的成长。给予他们足够的自主权和责任，让他们学会面对挑战和解决问题。孩子们的成长过程中，需要有失败和困难，而这也是他们个人成长的重要组成部分。\n\
\n\
一个发人深省的问题是：作为家长，在你的教育方式中，你是否给了孩子足够的自由和信任来发展他们自己的潜力？是否经常过度干涉或过于宠溺他们？让我们好好思考一下，如何在孩子成长的旅程中保持平衡和支持他们成为自信、有创造力的人。\n\

          The theoretical core of《自驱型成长：如何科学有效培养孩子的自律》(The Self-Driven Child) by 威廉·斯蒂克斯鲁德(William Stixrud) and 奈德·约翰逊(Ned Johnson) is to cultivate children's 自驱力 (self-driven capacity), aiming to enhance their 控制感 (sense of control), 胜任感 (sense of competence), and 自主感 (sense of autonomy) in their own lives. \
In terms of practical methods, the authors advocate for parents to become 顾问型家长 (consultant parents), a significant shift from being controllers or supporters to advisors to their children. This role change encourages parents to adopt a 'non-anxious presence' attitude, and to appreciate children, focusing on their strengths and efforts.\
The book also details some tools and steps to help parents implement the above theories and methods:\
1. 开放式问题 (Open-ended questions): For example, 'What do you think?' rather than interrogating them.\
2. 探索式语言 (Exploratory language): For example, 'I wonder...' rather than commanding.\
3. 信任式表达 (Trustful expressions): For example, 'I trust you to...' avoiding excessive worry and distrust.\
4. 邀请式邀请 (Invitational expressions): For example, 'I'd love to hear your thoughts on...'\
5. 赞扬式赞扬 (Appreciative praise): For example, 'I'm glad you...', rather than expressing disappointment and complaint.\
6. 解决问题式提问 (Problem-solving questions): For example, 'I wonder what you plan to do about this problem', encourage children to find their own solutions, rather than making decisions for them.\
7. 感受式询问 (Emotional inquiry): For example, 'I wonder how you feel about...', helping children to better understand their emotions, rather than denying their feelings.\
Through these tools and steps, parents can better help children build self-driving ability, resist stress, develop autonomy, and thus better face future challenges.\

《自驱型成长：如何科学有效培养孩子的自律》是一本关于培养孩子自我驱动力的指南。书中作者提出了自驱力的重要性以及如何帮助孩子培养自驱力的方法。下面我来逐点解读一下这本书的核心思想和要点。\n\
\n\
第一点，作者强调了自驱力的重要性。他们认为，培养孩子的自驱力能够增强他们对自己生活的控制感、胜任感和自主感。自驱力是孩子内在的动力，让他们能够自我激励、自我管理，并主动面对生活中的挑战和困难。\n\
\n\
第二点，书中提出了一种新的家长角色——顾问型家长。这种角色转变将家长从控制者或支持者变为顾问，让他们成为孩子生活中的导师和参谋。顾问型家长鼓励家长采取“非焦虑的陪伴”的态度，并注重发现和鼓励孩子的优点和努力。\n\
\n\
第三点，书中介绍了一些实用的方法和步骤来帮助家长实施上述理论和方法。其中包括开放式问题、探索式语言、信任式表达、邀请式邀请、赞扬式赞扬、解决问题式提问和感受式询问等。通过使用这些工具和步骤，家长可以更好地帮助孩子建立自驱力，抵抗压力，发展自主性，从而更好地面对未来的挑战。\n\
\n\
One more thing... 这本书的核心观点是要培养孩子的自驱力，而不是过度控制或过分支持他们。顾问型家长的角色转变可以促进孩子的成长和发展。关键在于家长要拥有一种“非焦虑的陪伴”的态度，鼓励孩子独立思考、自主决策，并关注他们的努力和进步。\n\
\n\
这本书为家长提供了可操作的工具和方法，帮助他们在养育孩子的过程中成为更好的顾问型家长。通过实施这些方法，家长可以激发孩子的自驱力，并让他们在成长过程中获得更多的自主性和自信心。\n\
\n\
最后，让我们思考一个问题：作为家长或者教育者，你如何在培养孩子的自驱力时，找到平衡点，既不过度控制又不过分放任？\n\
