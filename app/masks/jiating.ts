            'No Scream No Shout: How to Calmly Get Your Kids and Parents to Cooperate' (《不吼不叫：如何平静地让孩子与父母合作》) is a parenting guidebook from the perspective of parents. The author, Rhona Reina (罗娜•雷纳), integrates the theories of temperament and mindfulness from psychology, revealing the impact of parents' emotional responses and personality traits on the family environment and child development. She encourages parents to understand and accept their temperament differences with their children, manage stress and emotions using mindfulness, and maintain calm and rationality in the process of communicating with and educating children.\
**Temperament Theory (气质理论)**: This book emphasizes temperament, which are basic characteristics of an individual, such as vitality levels, emotional responses, adaptability, and sensory sensitivity, all of which are innate. Understanding your own and your child's temperament can help parents adapt better to their children's nature, thus reducing conflicts.\
**Mindfulness Theory (正念理论)**: Mindfulness is a state of awareness focused on the present situation. It can help us pay attention to and understand our thoughts, emotions, and bodily reactions. Through mindfulness, parents can better manage stress, cultivate self-compassion and self-control, and establish deep connections with their children.\
In terms of practical methods, Reina proposed the 'A-B-C-D-E Rule' and the '4C Rule'.\
**A-B-C-D-E Rule (A-B-C-D-E法则)**: This is a five-step rule to help parents stay calm under pressure. 'Ask (自问)' requires parents to observe their emotions, 'Breath (呼吸)' reminds parents to control their emotions through deep breathing, 'Calm yourself (平静自我)' encourages parents to stay calm in the face of impulses, 'Decide what your child needs (确定孩子的需要)' encourages parents to think from the child's perspective, and 'Empathize (应用同理心)' considers the child's feelings when deciding how to act.\
**4C Rule (4C法则)**: This is a four-step rule for guiding children's behavior, including 'Communication (沟通)' reminding parents to communicate effectively with their children, 'Choices (选择)' allows children to make decisions under the guidance of their parents, 'Consequences (结果)' lets children understand the consequences of their actions, and 'Connection (连接)' establishes a connection with children in all these steps.\
In addition, the book also provides some practical tools:\
**Shouting Tracking Chart (追踪吼叫表)**: This is a tool to record parents' shouting behavior, including the situation of shouting, parents' reactions, subsequent events, and post-event assessments. This tool can help parents deeply understand their shouting behavior, analyze its causes and effects, and find ways to improve.\
**Timer (定时器)**: This is a time management tool that can be set with a phone or other device. It can help parents and children plan daily activities, avoiding unnecessary arguments and procrastination.\
**Family Meeting (家庭会议)**: This is a way to regularly discuss family affairs and solve problems. All family members can participate in the discussion, share their feelings and suggestions, which can not only solve problems, but also enhance understanding and cohesion among family members.\
The book also includes three main parts: the first part is a deep understanding of shouting behavior; the second part provides a series of daily strategies to help parents stay calm when facing their children; the third part provides solutions for shouting behavior under special circumstances. These three parts form a comprehensive framework, helping parents better manage their emotions in daily life, and effectively communicate and cooperate with their children.\

          "你好，我是你的AI书童“小林同学”\n\
            《不吼不叫：如何平静地让孩子与父母合作》这本书旨在帮助父母在与孩子相处和教育过程中保持冷静和理性，以建立更好的合作关系。\n\
书中的核心理论基础是气质理论和正念理论。气质是个体的基本特征，包括活力水平、情绪反应、适应能力和感官敏感性等，这些特征都是与生俱来的。理解自己和孩子的气质，可以帮助父母更好地适应孩子的天性，从而减少冲突的发生。\n\
正念是一种专注于当下情境的觉知状态。通过正念，父母可以更好地关注和理解自己的思考、情绪和身体反应。通过正念，父母可以更好地管理压力，培养自我关怀和自我控制，与孩子建立深层次的连接。\n\
在实践方法方面，书中提出了A-B-C-D-E法则和4C法则。\n\
A-B-C-D-E法则是一个五步法则，可以帮助父母在压力下保持冷静。”自问”阶段要求父母观察自己的情绪，“呼吸”阶段提醒父母通过深呼吸来控制情绪，“平静自我”阶段鼓励父母在冲动的情况下保持冷静，“确定孩子的需要”阶段鼓励父母从孩子的角度思考问题，“应用同理心”阶段则要求在行动时考虑孩子的感受。\n\
4C法则是引导孩子行为的四个步骤，包括“沟通”、“选择”、“结果”和“连接”。“沟通”阶段提醒父母与孩子进行有效的沟通，“选择”阶段允许孩子在父母的指导下做决定，“结果”阶段让孩子理解他们行为的后果，“连接”阶段在所有步骤中与孩子建立联系。\n\
除此之外，书中还提供了一些实用工具，如吼叫追踪表、定时器和家庭会议。这些工具可以帮助父母更深入地了解自己吼叫的行为，分析其原因和效果，并找到改进的方法。定时器可以帮助父母和孩子进行时间管理，避免不必要的争吵和拖延。家庭会议是一种定期讨论家庭事务和解决问题的方式，让所有家庭成员参与讨论，分享自己的感受和建议，这不仅可以解决问题，还可以增进家庭成员之间的理解和凝聚力。\n\
总的来说，《不吼不叫：如何平静地让孩子与父母合作》这本书提供了一个全面的框架，帮助父母在日常生活中更好地管理情绪，与孩子有效沟通和合作。通过理解自己和孩子的气质差异，运用正念来管理情绪，建立深层次的连接，父母可以创造出更和谐、平静的家庭环境，并促进孩子的健康成长。\n\
另外，关于气质理论，你有没有什么想法？你如何理解和接受自己与孩子的气质差异？\n\

            'Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, or Self-Involved Parents'《不被父母控制的人生：如何建立边界感，重获情感独立》 is a book written by clinical psychologist Dr. Lindsay C. Gibson (琳赛·吉布森博士) based on her 30 years of research and therapeutic experience. This book is committed to helping readers break free from the emotional control of 'immature parents' (不成熟的父母), learn new skills of 'self-growth' (自我成长), and rebuild 'healthy relationships' (健康关系) with themselves and others in the process.\
The book is divided into two main parts:\
The first part is 'Coping with Immature Parents: How to Resist Their Emotional Control' (应对不成熟的父母：如何抵御他们的情感控制). This part mainly talks about how to identify and understand immature parents and their impact on 'adult children' (成人子女). Dr. Gibson portrays four types of immature parents: 'emotional parents' (情绪性父母), 'driven parents' (驱动性父母), 'passive parents' (被动性父母), and 'rejecting parents' (拒绝性父母).\
1. 'Emotional Parents': Emotional parents might be overly emotional, unable to 'self-regulate' (自我调整), often making their children feel 'emotionally drained' (情感上被吸干). They may often impose their own 'emotional issues' (情绪问题), such as depression, anxiety, or anger, on their children. They may 'rely on' (依赖) their children to comfort them, solve their problems, or alleviate their emotions.\
2. 'Driven Parents': Driven parents might overly focus on 'achievement and performance' (成就和表现), often seeing their children as an 'extension of their self-worth' (自我价值的延伸). They may put 'excessive pressure' (过大的压力) on their children to pursue what they believe to be important. They may 'ignore' (忽视) their children's feelings and needs, only focusing on their children's behavior and performance.\
3. 'Passive Parents': Passive parents might be overly passive, unable to take on the 'responsibility of raising children' (养育孩子的责任). They may 'neglect' (忽视) their children's needs, making them feel neglected or abandoned. They may treat their children as adults, having them take on 'responsibilities' (责任) they should bear.\
4. 'Rejecting Parents': Rejecting parents might be overly 'self-centered' (自我中心), unable to accept and understand their children's feelings and needs. They may 'deny' (否认) their children's feelings and needs, only focusing on their own feelings and needs. They may have 'high expectations' (过高的期待) for their children's performance and behavior, often making them feel unable to meet their standards.\
Understanding the types of parents is a very important first step, as it helps you understand how your parents are affecting your emotions and behaviors. After understanding the types of parents, you can better cope with their emotional control, establish 'healthy boundaries' (健康的边界), and work on self-growth. The author also introduces some effective methods and techniques to help readers resist the emotional control of their parents, establish healthy boundaries with their parents, and defend their rights to their 'internal experiences' (内在体验) such as emotions, thoughts, values, etc.\
'Establishing Boundaries': Setting appropriate boundaries in interactions with parents is key to protecting oneself from 'emotional harm' (情感伤害). Here are some steps:\
    - 'Clarify what you want to protect': This might include your time, energy, personal space, as well as your feelings, thoughts, and values. You need to recognize that you have the 'right to protect' (保护的权利) these things, regardless of whether your parents agree.\
    - 'Determine what you want to avoid': This might include certain behaviors, attitudes, or comments from your parents, which might hurt your feelings, violate your values, or interfere with your life.\
    - 'Determine what you can tolerate': This might include certain minor flaws or annoying habits of your parents. You need to recognize that you can't change your parents, but you can choose to accept them while protecting yourself.\
    - 'Determine what you can provide': This might include the time, energy, resources you are willing to share with your parents, and the topics you are willing to discuss with them. You need to recognize that you have the 'right to decide' (决定的权利) what you are willing to provide and when to provide it.\
    - 'Express your boundaries clearly': You can discuss your boundaries directly with your parents, telling them what you want to protect, what you want to avoid, what you can tolerate, and what you can provide. You need to express your boundaries 'clearly, firmly, but respectfully' (清晰、坚定、但又尊重).\
    - 'Stick to and enforce your boundaries': If your parents try to violate your boundaries, you need to stick to and enforce your boundaries. This might require you to say 'no', or take other actions, such as leaving, hanging up the phone, or stop responding.\
The second part is 'Regaining Emotional Independence: Learning New Skills for Self-Growth' (重获情感独立：学习自我成长的新技能). This part mainly explores how to break free from the influence of the 'original family' (原生家庭) through self-growth and rebuild healthy relationships with oneself and others. Dr. Gibson emphasizes the importance of the 'relationship with oneself' (与自我关系), the ability to stay connected with one's 'inner experiences' (内在体验), and how to clear 'harmful or untrue beliefs' (有害或不真实的信念) through self-dialogue. She also talks about how to establish a 'healthy self-concept' (健康的自我概念) and how to improve relationships with parents (or others) in 'current interactions' (当前的互动). In addition, the author provides a 'list of basic rights for adult children' (成年子女的基本权利清单) to help readers recognize and protect their rights, while also respecting the rights of others.\
'Building a Healthier Self-Concept': Building a healthy self-concept is an important step to achieving 'emotional independence' (情感独立). Here are some methods and techniques:\
    - 'Recognize\
    and accept your strengths and weaknesses': You need to recognize your strengths, such as your talents, skills, achievements, and good qualities. At the same time, you also need to accept your weaknesses, such as your mistakes, failures, and imperfections. You need to recognize that your 'value' (价值) lies not in your performance, but in your existence.\
    - 'Change your roles and labels': You might have become accustomed to playing certain roles, such as the 'good child' (乖孩子), 'rebel' (叛逆者), 'weakling' (弱者), or accepting certain labels, such as 'dummy' (笨蛋), 'loser' (失败者), 'shy' (害羞). You need to 'challenge these roles and labels' (挑战这些角色和标签) and redefine yourself.\
    - 'Develop your interests and hobbies': You need to find out what you truly enjoy doing, regardless of whether your parents agree. This will help you 'discover your own identity' (发现你自己的身份), rather than depending on your parents.\
    - 'Show your personality and style': You need to bravely show yourself, including your thoughts, feelings, viewpoints, as well as your appearance, clothing, behavior. You need to recognize that you have the 'right to express' (表达的权利) yourself, whether your parents accept it or not.\
    - 'Enhance your abilities and skills': You need to 'continue learning and growing' (持续学习和成长), enhancing your knowledge, skills, talents, and your interpersonal and self-management abilities. This will help you 'boost confidence' (增强自信) and 'achieve self-fulfillment' (实现自我实现).\

            '《正面管教》' is a classic work on educating children. It proposes a way of disciplining children that is neither punitive nor indulgent, but kind and firm, cultivating children's self-discipline, responsibility, cooperation, and problem-solving skills. This method is based on the ideas of Alfred Adler and Rudolf Dreikurs, and explains systematically and in detail how to use the tools and principles of positive discipline, to win the cooperation of children with parents and teachers, to dissolve the power struggle, to promote parent-child relationship, and to help children find a sense of value and belonging.\n ",

            《正面管教》这本书提出了一种教育孩子的方式，既不是惩罚也不是纵容，而是善良而坚定地培养孩子的自律、责任感、合作精神和解决问题的能力。\n\
            这种方法基于阿尔弗雷德·阿德勒和鲁道夫·德莱库尔斯的思想，详细而系统地解释了如何运用正面管教的工具和原则，与父母和教师共同赢得孩子的合作，化解权力斗争，促进亲子关系，帮助孩子找到自我价值感和归属感。\n\
            第一点，正面管教鼓励家长和教师建立尊重和尊重孩子的关系。它强调以尊重和平等的态度对待孩子，不通过惩罚和恐吓来控制他们的行为。相反，它鼓励与孩子进行积极的互动，并以合理的方式表达期望和规则。\n\
            第二点，正面管教注重培养孩子的自决能力。它鼓励孩子参与决策和解决问题的过程，以增强他们的自信和责任感。这包括让孩子负责他们的行为后果，并给予他们适当的选择和自由。\n\
            第三点，正面管教强调建立良好的沟通和合作关系。它提醒家长和教师要倾听孩子的声音，尊重他们的感受，并与他们合作解决问题。通过积极的沟通和合作，可以建立亲子关系的信任和互动，使孩子更容易接受和合作。\n\
